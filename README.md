# University-project-ASPNET-MVC-5
Simple ASP.NET MVC eCommerce web app.

I built an eCommerce website solution, as a hands-on ASP.NET learning project.This was an ongoing hands-on project for the ASP.NET Core 5 unit I undertook at CQU. A simple product page drawing from a database, and a shopping cart with sessions.

The purpose of this unit was to learn the basic concepts of MVC, Entity Framework, Migration Code-First database, and associated web application languages such as C#, Razor syntax, jQuery and more.

Ways this website can be improved:
1. Add Checkout.
2. Add Payment Gateway.
3. Add admin backend, to handle website (add/edit products, descriptions, and content).
4. Add Domain classes, controllers, tables, and code to handle Orders, customer accounts, shipping and returns.
5. Add login and authentication, for both admin and customers.
6. Add several layers of security.
